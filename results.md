In your snpArcher results folder you should see something that looks like this:

The first thing we'll take a look at is the overall QC data located in `./results/cracherodii/cracherodi_qc.html`:




Let's quickly inspect the VCFs to see what the differences are between them. We see that the `raw` folder still retains ALL snps and indels produced by the pipeline, but you can see some of the sites have been flagged by quality filters:

```
bgzip -dc cracherodi_raw.vcf.gz | grep -v "##"  | less -S****
```

 And those sites have been removed in the `filtered` vcf, which is what we'll use for additional downstream analyses.
